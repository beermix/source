Some of the Linux header files are not available on non Linux host
systems like FreeBSD or MacOSX.

The __le32 and __be32 types are only defined in Linux in
asm/byteorder.h, but not on all other BSD systems.
Use uint32_t instead of __le32 and __be32.

__swab32 is also a Linux only function, it looks like be32_to_cpu()
would be better here anyway.
